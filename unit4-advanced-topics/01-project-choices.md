Monday afternoon students are expected to figure out what projects they would like to do for their final capstone.

Some project ideas can be gleaned from the unit 2 project ideas (item number 20).  However, the project possibilities for this project are so much broader than the command-line applications, so you certainly shouldn't limit yourself to that.

## Project Criteria

* Pick a project you're excited about!
* This is the ultimate resume piece that you will be showing to employers, so take that into consideration.


The sky is the limit for project ideas.  However, I will be helping you limit the initial scope of your projects.

## Timeline

Monday: Figure out what you want to do
Tuesday: Finalize project ideas; Create wireframes and then user stories
Wednesday: Start coding

The goal is to complete the projects by March 7th.
